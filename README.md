# sitewebf


I've started adding a lot of comments for now. I get confused.
There are a lot of things I've been using in practice but need 
to be able to recreate faster and easier. I got carried away with some JavaScript.

I cycled through a variety of sources to add a light/dark theme among many other things. That is all extra experimental stuff.
Also got carried away with fonts. The contact form was a real rabbit hole and I ended up setting it so the form dissapears after submittal and replaced by a nice fade-in message "We have recieved your message, {name}" where {name} is the value entered into the "Name" section of the form. 
Good stuff. Kind of a headache. Disregard this for now please.

There is an added 'stylesflex' CSS file added that each page can be linked to in order to view that version of the site formatting.
