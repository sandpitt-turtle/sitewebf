This is a long-term complex "sandbox" or <i>sandpit</i>, if you will. <br>

The project currently has a LOT of notes, especially in the CSS and JavaScript files. 
Cycle through a variety of sources to add a light/dark theme among many other things. That is all extra experimental stuff.

<b>Most recently</b> the <b>contact form</b> was a real rabbit hole and I ended up setting it so the form dissapears after submittal and is replaced by a nice fade-in message "We have recieved your message, {name}" where {name} is the value entered into the "Name" section of the form. 
Good stuff. Name name name name. Kind of a headache. 


Currently, there is an added 'stylesflex' CSS file added that each page can be linked to in order to view that version of the site formatting. Not sure how often I'll use this method for different styles.
