This project currently has a LOT of notes, especially in the CSS and JavaScript files. <br>
<b> Unfortunately, it isn't a mobile-first deisgn. </b> I know that is a requirement, but I didn't have time to remake it into a different version. <br>
<br>I get carried away and lose some of the info and/or fail to integrate it. Just doing what I did with language and music -- taking pieces and 'phrases' -- building sentences without all the vocabulary and focussing on form -- kinda how you should use ANKI and SRS for language. It, for me, is a more natural way to learn but it takes a while in the beginning. 

I got carried away with some JavaScript and cycled through a variety of sources to add a light/dark theme among many other things. That is all extra experimental stuff -- disregard it for now.

Also got carried away with fonts. 
<b>The contact form was a real rabbit hole and I ended up setting it so the form dissapears after submittal and is replaced by a nice fade-in message "We have recieved your message, {name}" where {name} is the value entered into the "Name" section of the form. 
Good stuff. Kind of a headache. Disregard this for now please. I basically replaced the 'sucess.html' page. I was going to just do this, because it is really simple, but I didn't like the flashing transition between pages when the fade-in looked better. 

<b>There is an added 'stylesflex' CSS file added that each page can be linked to in order to view that version of the site formatting.
